# Tauri + React + Typescript Based App

MUST BE RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR

This application allows you to easily manage executables that you want running always with the High CPU Priority. Normally you'd need to navigate to: TaskManager>Executable>GoToDetails>SetPriority>High every time you launch the executable. With this app you just add the previously mentioned executable to the list with a few clicks and thanks to Windows Registry magic it will always launch with the high priority.

You can preview the regedit commands in the two generated .bat files after launching the app for the 1st time.
